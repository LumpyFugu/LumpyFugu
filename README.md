## 🔬 Featured Project

👉 Website for Travel Introduction, Sept. 2020 – Nov. 2020  
Designed a website to introduce how to travel in China and Australia.

✔ Designed the website layout and overall structure  
✔ Enabled user comments on each page to enhance engagement  
✔ Implemented interactive UI components (carousel, dropdown menus)  

👉 Website for Online Shopping, March. 2021 – June. 2021  
Designed an e-commerce system for a cake shop using a separated frontend and backend architecture.

✔ Developed core e-commerce functionalities, including product APIs, shopping cart, and order management workflow  
✔ Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using JWT  
✔ Built analytics dashboards with aggregated order data, enabling product filtering and visualization of sales trends  

👉 Research on Text Similarity Matching and Retrieval Algorithm, Sept. 2021 – March. 2022  
Compared and applied Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and Latent Dirichlet Allocation by Gensim library.

✔ Built a text similarity search system using Gensim by training Doc2Vec and LDA models on 1,900+ research paper abstracts collected via web scraping  
✔ Evaluated semantic similarity by retrieving top-k related documents and comparing embedding-based and topic-based approaches  
✔ Generated key insights: Word2Vec showed sentence-level similarity, while LDA performed better for document-level retrieval  

👉 Research on Entity-aware Neural Machine Translation, April. 2024 – Jan. 2026   
Designed a Transformer enhanced with Wikipedia2Vec knowledge embeddings.

✔ Developed an entity-aware Neural Machine Translation model by incorporating knowledge graph embeddings into a Transformer architecture  
✔ Engineered learnable gating and feature fusion strategies to optimize the interaction between token embeddings and external knowledge  
✔ Performed systematic evaluations and ablation studies, generating insights into effective knowledge integration for NMT
